<p>Here is a content page, but using html. This is how we could build custom product pages.<p>
<p>This content and metadata of this project page is stored within 'content/page/products.html'</p>
<p>The layout/frame for this page is stored within 'layouts/page/products.html'</p>
<p>We can use this same frame for all of the product pages</p>

<h2>Our Product is the best</h2>
<p>Imagine fancy html/css/javascript things here</p>
